# Forest Fire Simulator

A forest fire/wildfire simulation written in **Python** and compiled for the web using **pygbag**.  
The model visualizes how fire spreads through a field using simple cellular-automata rules, with
"realistic" humidity. :)

## Live Demo
Run the simulator directly in your browser:

**https://<your-username>.github.io/Forest-Fire-Simulator**

(No installation, no setup — it runs entirely in the browser through pygbag.)

## Features
- Python-based simulation logic  
- Real-time fire spread visualization  
- Adjustable parameters (e.g., burn probability, hydration levels)  
- Compiled to WebAssembly via pygbag for fast in-browser execution

## About
This project explores environmental simulation and emergent behavior using a classic forest fire model.

## Development
If you want to run or modify the project locally, you can edit the Python files in the repository and rebuild with pygbag.

(Regular users do **not** need to install anything.)

## License
Open source. Use it freely.
